My first 16 years of life were spent in Jhapa, which is in the eastern part of Nepal. My favorite pastime as a child was running through the paddy fields, admiring the blue sky during the day and the stars at night while daydreaming of one day flying up to the Chure Hills.
I came to Kathmandu to continue my education after completing my SLC. I decided to pursue my +2 in the science faculty because I have always wanted to be a scientist, even when my young mind didn't fully understand what a scientist actually does.
I finally got my hands on web technology after moving to Kathmandu and began to fall in love with it. I used to explore the tech world without getting tired, and as time passed, my curiosity about how the web functions and how it was created increased.
To quench my thirst for knowledge, I tried to pursue my bachelor's degree in information technology, where I was able to connect with others who shared my interests. To be able to understand the web, I had the opportunity to learn from experts, receive instruction from more experienced people and impart it to younger people, participate in various hackathons, and collaborate with a variety of people.
As of right now, my interest in the web has led me to become a web developer with more than a year of experience as a Laravel developer with better understanding of web.
Last but not least, when I have free time, I practice some cover songs on my guitar because folks have always praised my voice, and if I have more extra time, I like to take trips to the mountains.
